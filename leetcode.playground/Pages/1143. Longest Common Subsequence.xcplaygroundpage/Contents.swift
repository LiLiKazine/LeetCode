 1143. Longest Common Subsequence
 
 Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

 A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

 For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
 A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

  

 Example 1:

 Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
 Output: 3
 Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
 Example 2:

 Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
 Output: 3
 Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
 Example 3:

 Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
 Output: 0
 Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
  

 Constraints:

 1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
 text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.
