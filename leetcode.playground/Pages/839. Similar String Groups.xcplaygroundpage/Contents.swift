 839. Similar String Groups
 
 Two strings X and Y are similar if we can swap two letters (in different positions) of X, so that it equals Y. Also two strings X and Y are similar if they are equal.

 For example, "tars" and "rats" are similar (swapping at positions 0 and 2), and "rats" and "arts" are similar, but "star" is not similar to "tars", "rats", or "arts".

 Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: {"tars", "rats", "arts"} and {"star"}.  Notice that "tars" and "arts" are in the same group even though they are not similar.  Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.

 We are given a list strs of strings where every string in strs is an anagram of every other string in strs. How many groups are there?

  

 Example 1:

 Input: strs = ["tars","rats","arts","star"]
 Output: 2
 Example 2:

 Input: strs = ["omv","ovm"]
 Output: 1
  

 Constraints:

 1 <= strs.length <= 100
 1 <= strs[i].length <= 1000
 sum(strs[i].length) <= 2 * 104
 strs[i] consists of lowercase letters only.
 All words in strs have the same length and are anagrams of each other.
