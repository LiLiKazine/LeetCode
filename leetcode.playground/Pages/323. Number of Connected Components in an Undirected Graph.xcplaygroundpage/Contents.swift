 323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph
 ä¸­ç­‰
 
 You have a graph of n nodes. You are given an integer n and an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between ai and bi in the graph.

 Return the number of connected components in the graph.

  

 Example 1:


 Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,4]]
 Output: 2
 Example 2:


 Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
 Output: 1
  

 Constraints:

 1 <= n <= 2000
 1 <= edges.length <= 5000
 edges[i].length == 2
 0 <= ai <= bi < n
 ai != bi
 There are no repeated edges.
