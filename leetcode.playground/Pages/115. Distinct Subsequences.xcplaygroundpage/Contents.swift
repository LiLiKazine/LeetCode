 115. Distinct Subsequences
 
 Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

 A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

 It's guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

 Example 1:

 Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
 Output: 3
 Explanation:
 As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
 (The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

 rabbbit
 ^^^^ ^^
 rabbbit
 ^^ ^^^^
 rabbbit
 ^^^ ^^^
 Example 2:

 Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
 Output: 5
 Explanation:
 As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
 (The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

 babgbag
 ^^ ^
 babgbag
 ^^    ^
 babgbag
 ^    ^^
 babgbag
   ^  ^^
