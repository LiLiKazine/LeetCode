 面试题 04.08. First Common Ancestor LCCI
 
 Design an algorithm and write code to find the first common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree. Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure. NOTE: This is not necessarily a binary search tree.

 For example, Given the following tree: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

     3
    / \
   5   1
  / \ / \
 6  2 0  8
   / \
  7   4
 Example 1:

 Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
 Input: 3
 Explanation: The first common ancestor of node 5 and node 1 is node 3.
 Example 2:

 Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
 Output: 5
 Explanation: The first common ancestor of node 5 and node 4 is node 5.
 Notes:

 All node values are pairwise distinct.
 p, q are different node and both can be found in the given tree.
