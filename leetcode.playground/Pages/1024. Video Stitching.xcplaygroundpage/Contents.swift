 1024. Video Stitching
 
 You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted T seconds.  These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varied lengths.

 Each video clip clips[i] is an interval: it starts at time clips[i][0] and ends at time clips[i][1].  We can cut these clips into segments freely: for example, a clip [0, 7] can be cut into segments [0, 1] + [1, 3] + [3, 7].

 Return the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event ([0, T]).  If the task is impossible, return -1.

  

 Example 1:

 Input: clips = [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]], T = 10
 Output: 3
 Explanation:
 We take the clips [0,2], [8,10], [1,9]; a total of 3 clips.
 Then, we can reconstruct the sporting event as follows:
 We cut [1,9] into segments [1,2] + [2,8] + [8,9].
 Now we have segments [0,2] + [2,8] + [8,10] which cover the sporting event [0, 10].
 Example 2:

 Input: clips = [[0,1],[1,2]], T = 5
 Output: -1
 Explanation:
 We can't cover [0,5] with only [0,1] and [1,2].
 Example 3:

 Input: clips = [[0,1],[6,8],[0,2],[5,6],[0,4],[0,3],[6,7],[1,3],[4,7],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6],[3,4],[4,5],[5,7],[6,9]], T = 9
 Output: 3
 Explanation:
 We can take clips [0,4], [4,7], and [6,9].
 Example 4:

 Input: clips = [[0,4],[2,8]], T = 5
 Output: 2
 Explanation:
 Notice you can have extra video after the event ends.
  

 Constraints:

 1 <= clips.length <= 100
 0 <= clips[i][0] <= clips[i][1] <= 100
 0 <= T <= 100
