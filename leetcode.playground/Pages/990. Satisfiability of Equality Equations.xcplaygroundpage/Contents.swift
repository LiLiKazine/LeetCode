 990. Satisfiability of Equality Equations
 
 Given an array equations of strings that represent relationships between variables, each string equations[i] has length 4 and takes one of two different forms: "a==b" or "a!=b".  Here, a and b are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.

 Return true if and only if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations.

  

 Example 1:

 Input: ["a==b","b!=a"]
 Output: false
 Explanation: If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.  There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.
 Example 2:

 Input: ["b==a","a==b"]
 Output: true
 Explanation: We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.
 Example 3:

 Input: ["a==b","b==c","a==c"]
 Output: true
 Example 4:

 Input: ["a==b","b!=c","c==a"]
 Output: false
 Example 5:

 Input: ["c==c","b==d","x!=z"]
 Output: true
  

 Note:

 1 <= equations.length <= 500
 equations[i].length == 4
 equations[i][0] and equations[i][3] are lowercase letters
 equations[i][1] is either '=' or '!'
 equations[i][2] is '='
